=

## Group Members
- **Juan David VelÃ¡squez**
- **Jhon Fredy Alzate**

## System Information
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Python Version:** Python 3.12
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (latest version)

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement algorithms to compute the First and Follow sets of non-terminal symbols in a given context-free grammar. 

## Tools Used
- **Replit:** For collaborative coding remotely.
- **Visual Studio Code:** For development and debugging.

## Instructions for Running the Program

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssramirezr/project-teamjj.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Use the cd command to move into the project directory:
```bash
cd https://github.com/ssramirezr/project-teamjj.git
```
### 3. Run the Program
Execute the program using Python:
```bash
python main.py
```
or
```bash
py main.py
```
### 4. Input the Number of Cases
The program will prompt you to enter the number of cases (grammars) you want to input. Provide the number and press Enter.

### 5. Input the Number of Rules
For each grammar, the program will ask for the number of rules (derivations). Input the number and press Enter.

### 6. Input the Rules
Enter the rules for the grammar, one by one. For example, S AS B c is equivalent to S -> AS | B | c.

### 7. View the Results
After all the cases have been input, the program will compute and display the First and Follow sets for each non-terminal in each grammar.
